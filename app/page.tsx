                Late 2022 I decided to alter my path and give up my aspirations of going to medical school. I learned over time it wasn't something I was passionate about
                which lead me to start my current journey! I decied to enroll in Flatiron School's Software Engineering bootcamp and pursue a career in web development 
                instead as my curiosity for programming and the fundamentals behind it grew the more I learned about it.

                Once I got a good grasp of JavaScript I went ahead and made my first ever project. I decided to make something that I know people around me could use. Albeit the group
                is a little niche, but where I am from breweries are very popular and it seemed like there was always a conversation about what new brewery people should try. So that 
                led me to try and find a solution. What I did was create a SPA that allowed users to serve up 5 random breweries across the US utilizing plain old JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
